RE8 -> X4 bind-pose transfer: move a source mesh onto the X4 skeleton, bone
by bone.

Why a single rigid transform is not enough
------------------------------------------
Fitting one Kabsch transform over the matched bones leaves the torso within a
few centimetres but the hands ~25 cm and the toes ~11 cm away from the bones
that drive them, because the two rigs differ in *pose* (Rose's arms are
authored hanging forward, the X4 Biped's hang down) and in *proportions* (the
X4 torso and arms are much longer).  Skinning is defined against the bind
pose, so a vertex sitting 25 cm from its bone is dragged the wrong way by
every animation -- the "limbs bend backwards" symptom.

What this does
--------------
For every X4 bone B that a source bone maps onto, build one rigid transform

    x  ->  q_B + R_B (x - p_b)

with p_b the source bone position after the global frame fit, q_B the X4
bone's bind position, and R_B the minimal rotation taking the source bone axis
onto the target bone axis.  A vertex is then moved by the weighted blend of
the transforms of the bones that skin it -- linear blend skinning, applied
once at conversion time.

Two details that matter:

* the bone axis is the direction to the child bone, computed identically on
  both skeletons.  The source skeleton's bone matrices do NOT share a local
  axis convention (the spine's axis is in row 1, the upper arm's in row 0),
  so reading an axis out of the matrix rotates the spine by 90 deg and the
  left fingers by 172 deg.
* "folding" bones (jacket_*, Hair*_FK_*, *_Twist_*, FACIAL_*) have no
  counterpart position in the target rig; they inherit the transform of the
  nearest direct bone on the same side instead of being moved to their mapped
  bone.  Without that, a jacket gets pushed inside the ribcage.

#: them.  Half way keeps the web intact and the fingers close enough to their
#: bones to still bend sensibly.
#: Fingers bind to the palm, not to the finger bones.
#:
#: Rose authors her fingers *together*; the X4 biped splays them.  Matching
#: each finger to its own bone prises them apart, and the web between thumb
#: and index -- which has no geometry of its own, only the skin bridging the
#: two -- tears open until it looks like a piece is missing.  Blending half
#: way moves all five differently and distorts them worse.  Binding them to
#: the palm keeps the authored hand; the cost is that individual fingers no
#: longer animate, which hardly shows on an NPC.
